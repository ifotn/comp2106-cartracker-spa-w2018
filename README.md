<h1>Car Tracker SPA</h1>
<p>This single page application adds Angular to our in-class Node, Express, MongoDB application.</p>
<p>Our Express controller will get converted to a REST API with GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE methods, while we will create an Angular service to interact with the REST API and an Angular controller to interact with our HTML view.</p>
